# Bank Transaction & Revenue Monitoring System

## Project Overview
This project analyzes bank transaction data to monitor revenue generation, customer activity, and channel performance using SQL and Power BI.

## Objectives
- Clean and validate raw transaction data
- Design revenue logic using transaction fees
- Perform SQL-based business analysis
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard

## Tools Used
- PostgreSQL
- Power BI
- SQL
- Excel (initial inspection)

## Key Insights
- Branch channel generates the highest revenue and transaction volume
- Online transactions are frequent but low in revenue value
- Revenue trends closely follow transaction activity
- A small group of customers contributes most revenue

## Revenue Logic
Transaction fees were simulated as:
- Branch: ₦100 per debit
- ATM: ₦50 per debit
- Online: ₦20 per debit
- Credit transactions incur no fee
